# Polish-Space-Crusade
Third PJATK Gamejam project

Polish Space Crusade is a real time strategy game with grand scale space battles! In the game you play as the commander of the Polish space units. Your goal is to recapture all the planets in the solar system. Take back the Earth from the evil aliens!
Game was made during the 24-hour gamejam organized by the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw. Out of multiple contenders and teams, our team was the one that won the gamejam! The theme of the gamejam was: "Poland in space". That's why the game itself is a parody: what would happen if Poland was in space?
